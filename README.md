# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict heart disease using Logistic Regression.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: `heart.csv` (Kaggle Heart Disease dataset)
- Features include: age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, resting BP, fasting blood sugar, max heart rate, etc.
- Target: `condition` → 0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease Present

## 🔄 Workflow
1. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. 🧼 Data Preprocessing
3. 🔀 Train-Test Split
4. 🤖 Model Training with Logistic Regression
5. 📈 Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Classification Report)

## ✅ Results
- Accuracy: ~85% (varies by run)
- Clean visualizations using Seaborn
- Confusion matrix heatmap for model performance

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
